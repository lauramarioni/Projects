# PORTFOLIO 

- Drug Consumption: A dataset collected by Fehrman et al. (2017), freely available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Lichman, 2013) contains records of 1885 respondents regarding their use of 18 types of drugs and their measurements on 12 predictors. #' All predictors were originally categorical and were quantified by Fehrman et al. (2017). The meaning of the values can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+consumption+%28quantified%29. The original response categories for each drug were: never used the drug, used it over a decade ago, or in the last decade, year, month, week, or day. We transformed these into binary response categories, where 0 (non-user) consists of the categories never used the drug and used it over a decade ago and 1 (user) consists of all other categories.
